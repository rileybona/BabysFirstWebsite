        <h2>About</h2>
        <p> Hi there. This website was inspired the playlist I'm building in preperation for
            coding bootcamp. It's probably the thing I'm most excited about these days, except my desk,
            which I've also poured a <i>lot</i> of love into. Hard work is hard, and the next 6 months
            will be brutal‚Äî The trick is to make it fun. I do that with music.
        </p>
        <h2>My Story</h2>
        <p> I think the hardest I've ever worked was the end of high school. I look back and I can't believe how hard I worked then.
            I mean, how did I even do that? Well, I attribute most of my success that year to the soundtrack of Legally Blonde the Musical.
            I just have to figure out what music is going to help me succeed in bootcamp.
        </p>
        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p> The good news is, I don't have to do this alone. I've got a whole cohort of people here with the same goal as me.
            Besides being great and motivating, music is also a connector. There's nothing quite like sharing a good song with
            a friend. So‚Äî peruse my website, sign my form, and help me make the best coding playlist possible‚Äî the perfect wave üèÑ.
