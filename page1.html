        <h2>About</h2>
        <p> this will be my first paragraph of text probably introducing the site
            and the content of the site and all that really fun stuff
        </p>
        <h2>My Story</h2>
        <p> a secondary paragraph detailing interesting history, data, and insights
            about whatever the heck this website is going to be about. Or, perhaps,
            it's going to be an 'our story' type beat.
        </p>
        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>Finally, I point to my remaining three pages, where you'll find
            a form to sign up to my newsletter, addition sources of information,
            as well as a photo-diary of our work to date.
